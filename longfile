I would like to cover the arizona 520 area code and have a few
questions.

My parents' company would actually be running the server and are willing
to service all of the 520 area code, IF we can get the following
working:

I would actually like to allow people to email to a phone number and
automatically have my program check that email box and fax to that phone
number in the email address (ie: 1520xyz1234@golfbydesign.org).

Is this possible? one.

For instance:  If they emailed to 1520xyz1234@golfbydesign.org, the
email would get picked up by my popg (faxhq program) daemon, see that
the address was 520xyz1234 and fax it to 520xyz1234. (a hardcoded fax
number that could also be used as an email address)

Rather than having the customer have to format their email to in the
standard tpc format (nice for us techies...but it ticks off customers).

a real fast answer is appreciated.
Is this possible to do while still running a cell?

Jann

whoops. sorry I forgot to include you in the update list for the new version
of the exe. It's on the way. There is one major new feature, that is the
ability to block very large messages

[CONFIG]
Max Message Size=4096

The above example will block messages larger than 4MB and send a polite
message to the sender that the pop mail system isn't able to download such
large messages.

the file can be downloaded from http://www.lan1.com.au/hq/popg.zip

Hello,

On the cover page of the fax there is a line at the bottom that says:

------------------------
This Fax Was delivered using then [sic] tpc.int Network.  For more
information
http://www.tpc.int
------------------------

You can see that there is a spelling error (then instead of the).

Where can we change that?  We'd like to fix the spelling and reformat
the design of the pitch in order for it to blend in nicer with the
design of our cover page.

Second, if someone does not use your online fax generation form (which
still does not recognise the 604 area!) then the program send a fax with
a column of <'s where the cover page message would be.  Is there a way
to make it such that if there is no cover page message, then the <'s
don't get printed?

Third, is the stuff supposed to email a confirmation back to the sender
declaring whether or not the fax was delivered?  It would be nice if it
did.


Cheers,

Dave Cunningham

I don't understand, sorry. And your cell (fax.continuum.net) have been enabled 
for 604 for over a day now, as per your exchange file.

  DC> Third, is the stuff supposed to email a confirmation back to the sender

It's supposed to, yes, but I'm getting nothing from your cell. Please check HQERR.LOG for information, and also will you send me your FAX.INI, I suspect you may have a misconfig in there. In particular, please make sure you have reasonable values for nameserver and SMTP server, upon which your cell will rely heavily.

Okay, I think we're almost there.  I stopped the requeing/looping
problem by changing the SMTP server to a machine other than the one
running running FaxHQ.  Since FaxHQ has the smtpg.exe daemon I'd thought
that we could use it as the smtp server, but evidently not, so now the
smtp server is set to be the same as our pop server, and the looping
stopped.

As for the mail not getting delivered, the problem seems to be a slight
corruption of the domain name, namely the dropping of the first
character in it.

For example, if I send and email-to-be-faxed from omicron@jade.bc.ca,
the logs on the smtp server show the email address being replied to as
omicron@ade.bc.ca, which fails of course, since ade.bc.ca does not
exist.

If this is a faxhq cell, there is a sample cover sheet called HQCov.wri..
This is editable with write or wordpad. Put what you like in there by please
preserve the spaces between the keywords <>

Now comes the hardish bit.. You need to output this file to a postScript
file.. This is fairly easy, just print to file and click on the file check
mark. call it HQCOV1.PS and put in C:\TPCFax.. (Make sure you do a backup of
the original first). To test whether your cover page works without sending a
fax, run PSTEST.EXE..  Click the elipses button (Theone with ..) next to PS
Cover File.. Select The file you just created, HQCOV1.PS.. Now click the
Merge button. This wll merge the sample cover text below the merge button
with your file into a new postScript file.. Now click Convert and the
postScript image will be displayed.

The only problem you are likely to encounter is that the new win95
postScript doesn't output postScript in a "desirable" fashion for FaxHQ so
you need to use the win31 postScript driver which works quite happily in
win95 (NOT winNT). I have already supplied a setup file for this printer in
your C:\TPCFax directory, so all you have to do is get hold of a win3.x
pscript.drv file place it in C:\TPCFax and rename it to be PSOLD.DRV.. Now
go into Start, settings, printers and add a new printer.. Click have disk,
and point it to C:\TPCFax.. YOu will see the old driver appear.. Select and
you are done.

Hello,

Okay, I discovered the reason people were not getting their email
notifications of the status of their faxes was because the smtp relay
had filters set up to prevent it from being used as a spam relay, so now
people are getting their email notifications.

I've found something else though.  If I try to send an attachment, ie a
gif or jpeg file, the smtpg log says that it has received the attachemtn
and is converting it to a dcx format, but when FaxGate tries to deal
with it it chokes with an error that it is unable to import or export
the fax.  Can one not send .gif's and .jpeg's as attachements?  Do they
have to be postscript or tiff attachments?

Second, just a comment about the online fax form:

After one fills out the form and sends the fax it gives the message:

"sending fax to
remote-printer.ARBITRARY_STRING@16045551234.iddd.tpc.int"

Now, the fax does arrive, but if I pull up my mailer and type in that
exact syntax exactly, the fax does not arraive.  If I type in the
address as remote-printer.STRING@4.3.2.1.5.5.5.5.4.0.6.1.tpc.int it
*does* arrive, so I presume therefore that the fax-form CGI is
generating the second form of the address, but is telling the user that
it is sending the fax to the first form of the address, which, if
explicitly used, does not work.

Therefore, that message could confuse a lot of people as to what the
correct syntax for directly entering the destination fax number
themselves should be.

Finally, is there an option we can set in the .ini file that will
suppress the display of the smtp headers at the top of the fax?


Cheers,

Dave

I hope this is on topic, and I would appreciate any assistance I can
get.

I recently got a copy of HQFax (hq95-v92.exe) from a friend and
installed it to use Internet faxing. It worked OK for a while on my
Win95 PC but now I get error messages saying:

> 1) 	ILLEGAL FUNCTION CALL 5 HAS OCURRED IN EXPIRY DATE
> 
> 2) 	TYPR MISMATCH 13 HAS OCURRD IN EXPIRY DATE

> 4) 	PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPPLIER FOR MORE INFORMATION
> 	CURRENT DATE=1998/1/21 12:21:25PM
> 	EXPIRY DATE=000000

Any ideas on what I should do.

Thanks

I hope this is on topic, and I would appreciate any assistance I can
get.

I recently got a copy of HQFax (hq95-v92.exe) from a friend and
installed it to use Internet faxing. It worked OK for a while on my
Win95 PC but now I get error messages saying:

> 1) 	ILLEGAL FUNCTION CALL 5 HAS OCURRED IN EXPIRY DATE
> 
> 2) 	TYPR MISMATCH 13 HAS OCURRD IN EXPIRY DATE

> 4) 	PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPPLIER FOR MORE INFORMATION
> 	CURRENT DATE=1998/1/21 12:21:25PM
> 	EXPIRY DATE=000000

Any ideas on what I should do.

Thanks

Sorry, I cannot reproduce that on your gateway at the moment, I get:

[tpcadmin@hewes ~]$ telnet fax.continuum.net smtp
Trying 206.87.157.243...
Connected to fax.continuum.net.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 G'Day. HQ SMTP Server SMTPD 2.3 Ready.
helo continuum.net
250 HQ SMTP
    ^^^^^^^
Which is the correct response to the HELO command, as opposed to the 

500 Syntax Error, command unrecognized

which you were getting.

Hello,

What is the meaning of the dispatch rate?  Is that the maximum number of
messages per unit time that can go out, or the amount of time that must
pass before another one is sent?

One more thing,

After this happens once, mail will be accepted for faxing, and
notification is sent back to the sender saying it was received , but
they never get the message saying that it was delivered, which it wasn't
because The Fax Gateway software never sends the message.  If I stop and
restart it it complains about an "Object not set variable", and crashes.

I have to reboot the computer to stop that from happening, but the next
bad message that comes through, and it all starts over.

Now, I'd love to be able to run the Unix version, but I don't have the
machine with which to do that yet, so in the mean time I must hold the
line with a PC running WIN95, so it would be nice to get the stuff at
least up to the point where if a bad message craps out the the gateway
software, it doesn't stop subsequent messages from being undeliverable
(especially when the sender gets no notification that their message was
not sent).

------ =_NextPart_000_01BD2A48.075B0760
Content-Type: text/plain

We are interested in hosting a tpc.int cell to cover Hong Kong, but we
are a bit worried about being flooded by the traffic. We plan to use a
Windows NT server to process the email and deliver faxes.

One of the FAQs mentions being able to define "acceptable use policies"
and using this to restrict the fax traffic we send out. However, I
cannot find any other information about how this might be done. The only
possibly related thing I can find is that the Windows NT based server
installation information talks about limiting the number of fax
submitted from any email address. It then goes on to talk about setting
this in some "ini" file that I cannot find anywhere. Is there some way
we can limit the traffic? We do not mind dedicating 1-2 fax lines to
tpc.int, but we do not want that to be overwhelmed by the traffic so
that we look slow and stupid.

On a possibly related issue, I understand how the old addressing scheme
worked to direct emails to the server that would deliver the faxes. I do
not quite see how the new addressing scheme achieves the same goal, and
I cannot find an explanation of the operation of the new addressing
scheme. How does it work? By new addressing scheme I mean the one that
has the iddd stuff in it.

With the old addressing scheme the email traffic must come to the cell
server, or at least to a "randomly" selected one of the servers covering
the cell. I do not see of any way to limit the traffic to each server,
so that any policy to limit things must be implemented in the server. As
I am not clear on how the new addressing works, I cannot comment on it.

Thank you for any information/enlightenment that can be provided.

You can block traffic by email address, by destination fax number. You can
limit traffic to a fixed number in a 7 day period also by email address or

The IDD address is the same as the old address, just a different way of
looking at it.
