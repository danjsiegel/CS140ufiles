1. What are tha names of the parts of a unix command? List them, and give a brief description of each. 

A unix command can have options, filenames, and arguments.
An Option is a way to specify a way to do a command. Ie ls -a

Arguments are a piece of info that you must pass into the command in order for it to work correctly. 

2. Can multiple UNIX commands be typed on the same single command line? Explain how.
